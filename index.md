**Spatial analyst specializing in short-term desktop GIS and spatial analysis projects.**

I support research, planning, and consulting teams with clear, decision-focused spatial analysis using ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, and R.

I developed my GIS skills and experience during my masters in Geo-information Science at Wageningen University and PhD at Utrecht University, both renowned institutions in the Netherlands. During these nine years, I learned how to solve multidisciplinary and complex issues using GIS, geoinformatics, remote sensing, and coding. I learned how to collect, manage, analyze, and present spatial data using various tools and methods.

I am interested in how GIS technology can help societies assess and meet challenges such as climate change and global urbanization. I enjoy applying my skills and knowledge in GIS to my passion of studying and improving cities and societies' functions, and my skills and experience with data handling to translate complex data concepts into structured, reusable knowledge. I focus on applied spatial analysis for research, environmental, and planning projects.
