## Project description
The goal of this project was to develop a banana yield model for an Eaglesening client for their banana farm in Ecuador using available data. This project involved studying the relationships between accessible data on environmental variables and data on past yields for this farm. 



## Data
-cumulative rainfall datasets
-crop age datasets
-waterlogging datasets
-NDVI datasets
-tree location datasets

## Methods
Datasets of the trees and water loggining were cleaned. The model was built using multilinear regression with the datasets as inputs, with various revision rounds. Model was compared to previous banana yields, and difference between predicted yield and actual yield was also calculated. 

## Tools
- ArcGIS 
- R 

## Outcome
The outcome of the model was successful with predicting yields within an acceptable range of possible values.
