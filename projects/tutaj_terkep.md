## Project description
Every ten years, the Hungarian Scout Association organizes a ten day camping trip for Hungarian scout troops around the world. The scouts first build rafts, and then row down the Tisza river, experiencing exposure to Hungarian history, culture and language. The theme for this camping trip was the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin, which occurred between 895 and 900 AD. The design and artistic details of this map reflects this time period.

This map was designed with the questions in mind: Where does the camping trip start and end, what is in the local surroundings, and where will camp be set up each night? 

## Data
-Basemap in ArcGIS Pro
-Hungarian guide books and maps of the local areas
-camping trip information provided by the Hungarian Scout Association.


## Methods
Area of interest was marked in a base map in ArcGIS Pro, and transferred to Krita, a digital drawing program. Using local map guides of the area, locations of interest where emphasized and artistic details were created. During the multiple revisions, geographically correct land-use, town locations, and river location was balanced with aesthetically pleasing and comprehensible map with artistic details relevant for the camp theme.

 

## Tools
- ArcGIS Pro
- R (sf)

## Outcome
An illustrated, antique-style historical map of a region of the Tisza river in Hungary, that the scouts used during thier ten day camping trip to know where camping events will occur and to be familiar with their local surroundings.
