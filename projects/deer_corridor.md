## Project description
The area depicted in this map is situated in the Renkums Beekdal, a nature reserve in Renkum, the Netherlands. Here, deer migrate from an area next to the highway A12 (which is located near the Veluwe National Park) to the floodplains of the Rhine. The purpose of this map was to determine the most optimal route to create an ecological connection zone for the deer to travel between two areas. Proximity to forests, meadows, and urban areas was taken into account. 


## Data
- vector maps of land uses, buildings, roads, bodies of water.

## Methods
The processing method consisted of carrying out various ArcGIS tools on datasets through model builder in ArcGIS. The model was created in various stages and perfected until the final result shown in the map was produced.Within ArcGIS, tools were used to combine datasets, classify, determine color schemes, and determine map design.


## Tools
- ArcGIS
- model builder

## Outcome
Presents how deer will most likely move within this corridor, as shown by the lowest 10% of the Accumulated Suitability Cost, with lighter colors being more suitable (more likely that deer will travel a specific path).
